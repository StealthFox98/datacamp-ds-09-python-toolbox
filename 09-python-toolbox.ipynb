    "The reason that we can loop over specific objects is that they are iterables (lists, strings and range objects, among others).\n",
    "\n",
    "- An iterable is an object that has an associated iter method.\n",
    "    - Once this iter method is applied to an iterable, an iterator object is created.\n",
    "- An iterator is defined as an object that has an associated next method that produces the consecutive values.\n",
    "    - To create an iterator from an iterable, all we need to do is use the function iter and pass it the iterable.\n",
    "- Once we have the iterator defined, we pass it to the function next and this returns the first value.\n",
    "    - Calling next again on the iterator returns the next value until there are no values left to return and then it throws us a StopIteration error.\n",
